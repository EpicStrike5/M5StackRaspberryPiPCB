# M5StackRaspberryPiPCB
A simple dev board for using decentralized I/O port from the both of them 

I created this PCB for the sole purpose of decentralizing the I/O port for both the M5Stack Gray and the Raspberry Pi4. The intent is that it's easier to develop on a breadboard with a "fixed" Pi or M5. 

The gist is that we have female header and we decide to populate half of the pin holes ith header. In the case of a 1x2 Header, we solder a 1P header and leaves one hole free so that we can plug rigid cable if we don't want to use jumpers.
