# M5StackRaspberryPiPCB
A simple dev board for using decentralized I/O port from the both of them 

I created this PCB for the sole purpose of decentralizing the I/O port for both the M5Stack Gray and the Raspberry Pi4. The intent is that it's easier to develop on a breadboard with a "fixed" raspberry.
